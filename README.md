# Deep Learning Notebooks
This repository contains a collection of notebooks that I used in tutorials and training.  

---
### Standard Neural Networks Tutorial 1
This is a simple notebook that will train the MNIST dataset using a standard neural network.  
It will teach how to:
* Load and Preprocess data
* Create a Sequential Model
* Compile and view the model
* Calculate the number of parameters in the model
* Train
* Visualise training results
* Predict an uploaded image

### Standard Neural Networks Tutorial 2
This notebooks's aim is to show how to create a custom layer. It uses the MNIST dataset.

We will create a layer that we will call __Linear__ which is the same as the Keras __Dense__ one i.e. calculates __*y = wx + b*__  
This notebook will teach how to:
* Load and Preprocess data
* Create a custom layer
* Use Keras Functional Model
* Create a Callback to stop a model training when accuracy reaches a desired value

### Convolutional Neural Networks Tutorial 1
This is a simple notebook that will train the CIFAR10 dataset using a convolutional neural network  
It will teach how to:
* Load and Preprocess data
* Create a Sequential Model
* Compile and view the model
* Calculate the number of parameters in the model
* Train
* Visualise training results
* Test the model on an uploaded image
* Compare CPU and GPU training times

### Convolutional Neural Networks Tutorial 2
This notebook will show how to:
* Load a pretrained model (VGG-16)
* Use it for prediction

### Telecom Customer Churn (Binary Classification)
This is a binary classification problem to detect Telecom customers who are probably going to churn.
It uses the following dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

### Structured Data Classification using TensorFlow Decision Forests
This is an example on how to use TensorFlow Decision Forests on structured data.
This notebook was created as part of Kaggle's Tabular Playground Series - Sep 2021 (https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-sep-2021)
