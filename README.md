# deep-learning-notebooks
This repository contains a collection of notebooks that I used in tutorials and training.

### Standard Neural Networks Tutorial 1
This is a simple notebook that will train the MNIST dataset using a standard neural network.  
It will teach how to:
* Load and Preprocess data
* Create a Sequential Model
* Compile and view the model
* Calculate the number of parameters in the model
* Train
* Visualise training results
* Predict an uploaded image

### Standard Neural Networks Tutorial 2
This notebooks's aim is to show how to create a custom layer. It uses the MNIST dataset.

We will create a layer that we will call __Linear__ which is the same as the Keras __Dense__ one i.e. calculates __*y = wx + b*__  
This notebook will teach how to:
* Load and Preprocess data
* Create a custom layer
* Use Keras Functional Model
* Create a Callback to stop a model training when accuracy reaches a desired value

### Convolutional Neural Networks Tutorial 1
This is a simple notebook that will train the CIFAR10 dataset using a convolutional neural network  
It will teach how to:
* Load and Preprocess data
* Create a Sequential Model
* Compile and view the model
* Calculate the number of parameters in the model
* Train
* Visualise training results
* Test the model on an uploaded image
* Compare CPU and GPU training times

### Convolutional Neural Networks Tutorial 2
This notebook will show how to:
* Load a pretrained model (VGG-16)
* Use it for prediction

### Telecom Customer Churn (Binary Classification)
This is a binary classification problem to detect Telecom customers who are probably going to churn.
It uses the following dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
